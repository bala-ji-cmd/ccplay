### 2.3. pillar 3: story - the engine for narrative

**user stories:**
- as a parent, i want to create a unique and magical bedtime story for my child quickly and easily.

- **metric 2.3.b (user satisfaction):** a user rating system (1-5 stars) for each generated story. goal: average rating > 4.5.
- **metric 2.3.c (read-again rate):** percentage of saved stories that are opened more than once.

### 2.4. pillar 4: compete - the playground for collaboration

**user stories:**
- as a child, i want a fun daily challenge where i can draw the same thing as other kids and see how we all did it differently.
- as a child, i want to know that i can "win" for having a cool idea or trying something new, not just for having the "best" drawing.

**functional requirements:**
- **2.4.1. daily drawing challenge:** the platform shall present a single, universal drawing prompt to all users each day.
- **2.4.2. multiplayer environment:** the ui will provide an anonymized, real-time view of other users' progress (e.g., as ghosted, in-progress sketches) to foster a sense of shared experience.
- **2.4.3. journey-based scoring algorithm:** the system will analyze the user's creative process, not the final output. it will assign scores based on a weighted algorithm of factors including:
    - number of distinct concepts attempted (e.g., major erasures and restarts).
    - variety of tools and colors used.
    - time spent on different phases of the drawing.
- **2.4.4. multi-winner recognition:** at the end of each challenge, the platform will highlight several participants in different categories (e.g., "most creative journey," "most colorful exploration," "bravest idea"), ensuring a positive and inclusive outcome.

### 2.5. pillar 5: imagination engine - the partner in creation

**user stories:**
- as a child, when i'm writing a story and get stuck, i want the app to give me a fun idea to keep going, like a little helper.
- as a child, i want to be able to ignore the helper if i don't need it, without it getting in my way.
- as a parent, i want to see if the app is helping my child become a more confident storyteller over time.

**functional requirements:**
- **2.5.1. pause detection:** the system shall detect when a user has paused their writing or dictation for a configurable period (e.g., 7-10 seconds).
- **2.5.2. contextual nudge generation:** the system will analyze the last few sentences of the user's text and generate a relevant, open-ended, imagination-igniting prompt (e.g., "what if the character suddenly found a secret door?").
- **2.5.3. non-intrusive ui:** the prompt will be delivered via a gentle, easily-dismissible ui element that does not interrupt the user's workflow if they choose to ignore it.
- **2.5.4. "stuck moment" analytics:** the system shall log every instance a prompt is triggered. this data will be aggregated and presented in a parent-facing dashboard.

**success metrics:**
- **metric 2.5.a (stuck-moment reduction):** track the average number of "stuck moments" per 100 words written for each user. the primary goal is to see this metric decrease over a 3-month period.
