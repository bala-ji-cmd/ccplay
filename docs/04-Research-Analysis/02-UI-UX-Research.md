  - **pen tool:** pencil icon with three stroke sizes (2px, 4px, 8px) in a dropdown menu
  - **eraser tool:** eraser icon with three sizes (10px, 20px, 30px) in a dropdown menu
  - **undo button:** curved arrow icon with disabled state when no history available
  - **clear canvas:** trash icon with confirmation modal to prevent accidental clearing
- **visual design:** circular buttons with hover effects, active states, and smooth animations
- **stroke size selection:** dropdown menus with visual size indicators and hover states

### 1.3 ai interaction controls
- **voice command activation:**
  - **voicemicrophonebutton:** large, animated circular button (64x64px) with multiple states
  - **visual states:** idle (blue), recording (red), processing (yellow), error (red)
  - **real-time feedback:** sound wave visualization, recording timer, audio level indicators
  - **time limits:** 30-second maximum with progressive color warnings (80%, 90%, 100%)
- **text input integration:**
  - **prompt bar:** whatsapp-style input field with dynamic placeholders
  - **state-based styling:** different border colors for recording (red), processing (yellow), normal (green)
  - **responsive layout:** horizontal on desktop, vertical stack on mobile
  - **send button:** large circular button with send icon and hover animations

### 1.4 drawing management
- **drawing name:** editable title with pencil icon hover effect
- **new drawing button:** plus icon in a circular purple button
- **edit counter:** visual indicator showing remaining edits (max 5)
- **action buttons:** save, colorize, download, share with consistent styling and animations

## 2. design system and theming

### 2.1 color palette (implemented)
- **primary colors:**
  - purple: `#8549ba` (main brand color)
  - green: `#58cc02` (success/action color)
  - blue: `#1cb0f6` (info/download color)
  - orange: `#ff9600` (warning/colorize color)
  - red: `#ff4b4b` (error/recording color)
  - yellow: `#ffd900` (accent/border color)
- **background colors:**
  - canvas: `#ffffff` with 90% opacity
  - page: `#fff9e5` (notebook paper background)
  - input: `#fff9e5` with green border

### 2.2 typography
- **primary font:** comic sans ms for all user-facing text
- **font sizes:** responsive scaling (2xl-3xl for headings, lg for body text)
- **font weights:** bold for headings and buttons, medium for body text

### 2.3 animation system
- **framework:** framer motion for smooth, performant animations
- **button interactions:** scale effects on hover (1.05x) and tap (0.95x)
- **state transitions:** 300ms easing transitions between states
- **loading states:** spinning icons, pulsing borders, and progress indicators
- **micro-interactions:** pop sound effects, confetti animations, and visual feedback

## 3. voice recording implementation

### 3.1 voicemicrophonebutton component
- **multi-state design:**
  - **idle:** blue gradient with gentle breathing animation
  - **recording:** red gradient with dual pulsing rings and audio level visualization
  - **processing:** yellow gradient with rotating ring and spinning icon
  - **error:** red gradient with warning pulse animation
- **visual feedback:**
  - **sound wave:** 12 animated bars responding to real-time audio levels
  - **timer display:** mm:ss format with clock icon and color-coded warnings
  - **status indicators:** animated emojis and descriptive text for each state
  - **accessibility:** aria labels and keyboard navigation support

### 3.2 voice recording flow
- **permission handling:** automatic microphone access request with error messaging
- **recording controls:** tap to start/stop with automatic silence detection (3 seconds)
- **audio processing:** real-time transcription via gemini api with progressive stages
- **error recovery:** clear error messages and retry functionality
- **integration:** seamless text population and editing capabilities

## 4. user experience patterns

### 4.1 responsive design
- **desktop layout:** horizontal tool arrangement with side-by-side voice and text input
- **mobile layout:** vertical stacking with centered voice button and full-width text input
- **touch optimization:** large touch targets (minimum 44px) with proper spacing
