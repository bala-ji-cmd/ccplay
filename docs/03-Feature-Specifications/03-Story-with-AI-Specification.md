## 5. success metrics & measurement

the success of the `story` pillar will be measured by its ability to create valuable and engaging content for parents and children.

- **metric 2.3.a (generation frequency - primary):**
    - **metric:** average number of stories generated per active user per week.
    - **target:** 1.5 stories/user/week.
    - **measurement:** log an event for every successful story generation. aggregate weekly per user.

- **metric 2.3.b (user satisfaction - primary):**
    - **metric:** a user rating system (1-5 stars) presented after a story is read.
    - **target:** achieve and maintain an average user rating of >4.5 stars.
    - **measurement:** prompt for a rating after a user has been on the story screen for at least 60 seconds. store and average all ratings.

- **metric 2.3.c (narration engagement - primary):**
    - **metric:** percentage of stories where users listen to the full narration (from start to finish).
    - **target:** 70% of stories are listened to completely.
    - **measurement:** track audio playback events and calculate completion rate per story.

- **metric 2.3.d (narrator preference - secondary):**
    - **metric:** distribution of narrator character selections across all story generations.
    - **target:** relatively even distribution (10-20% each) indicating all characters are appealing.
    - **measurement:** log narrator selection with each story generation and analyze distribution.

- **metric 2.3.e (read-again rate - secondary):**
    - **metric:** the percentage of saved stories in the library that are opened more than once.
    - **target:** 30% of saved stories are re-read.
    - **measurement:** log an event each time a saved story is opened from the library. calculate `(users who have re-read at least one story) / (users who have saved at least one story)`.

## 6. technical considerations

- **llm prompt engineering:** the prompts sent to the language model are critical. they must be carefully engineered to consistently produce stories that meet all length, tone, structure, and safety requirements based on the user's sparse inputs.
- **image generation consistency:** the image generation model must be prompted to produce visuals that are thematically and stylistically aligned with the text of the story. a process may be needed to extract key visual descriptors from the generated story to feed into the image prompt.
- **content safety filters:** a multi-layered safety protocol is required for both text and image generation to prevent the creation of any inappropriate content. this must be 100% effective.
- **voice synthesis technology:** the system must use advanced text-to-speech technology that produces natural, human-like voices with appropriate emotional inflection, pacing, and character personality. this should not be basic robotic text-to-speech but rather sophisticated voice synthesis that can convey warmth, excitement, and storytelling nuance.
- **audio optimization:** generated audio must be optimized for children's listening with clear pronunciation, appropriate volume levels, and natural speech patterns that maintain engagement throughout the story duration.

## 7. future enhancements (post-v1)

- **interactive narration:** allow children to tap on words or phrases to hear them repeated or emphasized.
- **character consistency:** allow users to save a custom character (e.g., "leo the lion") and feature them in multiple different stories.
- **story series:** the ability to generate a "chapter 2" for a saved story, continuing the adventure.
- **printable storybooks:** an option to export a saved story and its image into a simple, printable pdf format to create a physical copy.
- **multi-language support:** offer narration in multiple languages with culturally appropriate character voices.
- **custom narrator voices:** allow parents to record their own voice as a narrator option for personalized storytelling.
