## 4. functional requirements

### 4.1. story generation interface
- **fr-s1:** the system shall present a simple, single-screen interface for generating a new story.
- **fr-s2:** the interface must include the following user-selectable options:
    - **genre selection (required):** a dropdown list of at least 20 distinct, child-friendly genres (e.g., magical everyday object, animal adventures, super tiny heroes).
    - **character/object input (optional):** a text field allowing the user to input a name or object to be featured in the story. this field will be accompanied by a `voicemicrophonebutton` to enable voice input.
    - **moral value selection (optional):** a dropdown list of simple, positive moral values (e.g., kindness, honesty, courage, sharing).
- **fr-s3:** a prominent "create story" button shall trigger the generation process.

#### 4.1.1. voice input for character/object
-   **fr-s2.1 (ui and flow):** the voice input for the character/object field will use the same `voicemicrophonebutton` and `usevoicerecording` hook as the `draw` pillar. the entire flow—including permission requests, recording states with visual feedback, silence detection, and transcription—will be identical.
-   **fr-s2.2 (population and editing):** upon successful transcription, the returned text will populate the "character/object input" text field. the user can then edit the text before creating the story.

### 4.2. ai-powered story & image generation
- **fr-s4:** upon triggering generation, the system shall produce a unique, original story based on the user's inputs.
- **fr-s5:** all generated stories must adhere to the following constraints:
    - **length:** under 500 words.
    - **structure:** a clear beginning (introduction), middle (challenge/adventure), and end (happy resolution).
    - **tone:** warm, simple, and engaging, suitable for the target age group.
    - **moral integration:** if a moral is selected, it must be integrated implicitly into the narrative's theme, not stated explicitly as a lesson.
- **fr-s6:** simultaneously, the system shall generate a high-quality, full-color banner image that visually represents a key character or scene from the generated story. the art style must be soft, cheerful, and consistent with a children's picture book aesthetic.

### 4.3. story presentation & library
- **fr-s7:** the generated story text and banner image shall be displayed together on a clean, readable "story" screen.
- **fr-s8:** the story screen must include controls to:
    - **save story:** add the current story to the user's personal library.
    - **generate new story:** return to the generation interface.
- **fr-s9:** a dedicated "story library" shall provide access to all saved stories, displayed with their title and banner image as thumbnails.

## 5. success metrics & measurement

the success of the `story` pillar will be measured by its ability to create valuable and engaging content for parents and children.

- **metric 2.3.a (generation frequency - primary):**
    - **metric:** average number of stories generated per active user per week.
    - **target:** 1.5 stories/user/week.
    - **measurement:** log an event for every successful story generation. aggregate weekly per user.

- **metric 2.3.b (user satisfaction - primary):**
    - **metric:** a user rating system (1-5 stars) presented after a story is read.
    - **target:** achieve and maintain an average user rating of >4.5 stars.
    - **measurement:** prompt for a rating after a user has been on the story screen for at least 60 seconds. store and average all ratings.

- **metric 2.3.c (read-again rate - secondary):**
    - **metric:** the percentage of saved stories in the library that are opened more than once.
    - **target:** 30% of saved stories are re-read.
    - **measurement:** log an event each time a saved story is opened from the library. calculate `(users who have re-read at least one story) / (users who have saved at least one story)`.

## 6. technical considerations

- **llm prompt engineering:** the prompts sent to the language model are critical. they must be carefully engineered to consistently produce stories that meet all length, tone, structure, and safety requirements based on the user's sparse inputs.
- **image generation consistency:** the image generation model must be prompted to produce visuals that are thematically and stylistically aligned with the text of the story. a process may be needed to extract key visual descriptors from the generated story to feed into the image prompt.
- **content safety filters:** a multi-layered safety protocol is required for both text and image generation to prevent the creation of any inappropriate content. this must be 100% effective.

## 7. future enhancements (post-v1)

- **audio narration:** an option to have the generated story read aloud by a selection of warm, friendly voices.
- **character consistency:** allow users to save a custom character (e.g., "leo the lion") and feature them in multiple different stories.
- **story series:** the ability to generate a "chapter 2" for a saved story, continuing the adventure.
- **printable storybooks:** an option to export a saved story and its image into a simple, printable pdf format to create a physical copy.
