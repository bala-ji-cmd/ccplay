**Generate a step-by-step drawing guide for a kid to learn how to draw "${thingToDraw}" in EXACTLY 6 simple steps.**  

**IMPORTANT: You must generate exactly 6 images - one for each step. Do not skip any steps.**

- Each step should be **easy to follow** and progressively build the final drawing.  
- Use **bold stroke lines (heavy marker style)** for clarity.  
- Keep the **resolution high (1920x1080 Full HD)**  16:9 aspect ratio to maintain quality.  
- **Do not add any annotations, text, or labels to the images**‚Äîthey should be purely visual.  
- **Generate exactly 6 images total** - no more, no less.

### **Breakdown of Each Step (Generate 1 image per step):**  
1Ô∏è‚É£ **Start with the simplest shape** ‚Äì Begin with **basic circles, squares, or lines** to outline the structure.  
2Ô∏è‚É£ **Add more structure** ‚Äì Introduce additional **simple shapes** to develop the main form.  
3Ô∏è‚É£ **Define key features** ‚Äì Outline **recognizable features** while keeping it minimal.  
4Ô∏è‚É£ **Refine the details** ‚Äì Enhance proportions slightly, but **keep it simple**.  
5Ô∏è‚É£ **Final touches** ‚Äì Add any small but important finishing elements.  
6Ô∏è‚É£ **Complete and color** ‚Äì Encourage creativity by suggesting fun ways to **color or customize** the drawing.  

**Remember: Generate exactly 6 images total, one for each numbered step above.**

By ensuring **bold strokes, high resolution, and structured simplicity**, kids will have a fun and intuitive drawing experience! üöÄ
