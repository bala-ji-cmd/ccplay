** Generate a series of 8 images illustrating the step-by-step process of drawing a [**TARGET SUBJECT - e.g., happy dog, blooming flower, speedy car, funny robot**] using a simple, cartoonish style suitable for teaching children. Each image should clearly depict one of the following steps, labeled with the step number (e.g., "Step 1:", "Step 2:"):
**Step 1: The Funny First Shape!***   **Description:** Show a single, basic, slightly imperfect shape that serves as the starting point for the [**TARGET SUBJECT**]. Suggest a common basic shape relevant to the subject (e.g., "a wobbly circle for a dog's head," "a slightly curved line for a flower's stem," "a rounded rectangle for a car's body," "a square for a robot's body"). Keep the line simple and clear.
**Step 2: Adding a Buddy Shape (or Two!)***   **Description:** Show the first shape with one or two additional simple shapes that build upon it to create the basic form of the [**TARGET SUBJECT**] (e.g., "adding a bigger oval for the dog's body and two floppy ear shapes," "adding a circle for the flower's center and a leaf shape," "adding circles for the car's wheels," "adding a rectangle for the robot's head"). Illustrate how these shapes connect or overlap.
**Step 3: Sneaky Lines for Connections!***   **Description:** Show the combined shapes with simple, light lines connecting them to form a more cohesive outline of the [**TARGET SUBJECT**]. Highlight how the individual shapes are now linked together (e.g., "curved lines connecting the dog's head to its body and ears," "lines connecting the stem to the center and the leaf," "lines rounding out the car's body and connecting the wheels," "lines connecting the robot's head to its body").
**Step 4: Erase the "Oops!" Lines (and Some Helpers!)***   **Description:** Show the drawing from Step 3 with the internal lines where the initial shapes overlapped now lightly erased, resulting in a cleaner outline of the basic form of the [**TARGET SUBJECT**]. The connecting "sneaky lines" should remain visible as the main outline.
**Step 5: Adding Funny Features!***   **Description:** Show the basic outline of the [**TARGET SUBJECT**] with the addition of simple, cartoonish features that make it recognizable (e.g., "adding big, round eyes, a simple nose, and a smiling mouth to the dog's head," "adding simple petal shapes around the flower's center," "adding simple headlights and a windshield to the car," "adding simple circular eyes, a blocky mouth, and antenna to the robot's head").
**Step 6: Simple Shading for "Pop"!***   **Description:** Show the drawing with very basic shading added to one side of the [**TARGET SUBJECT**] to suggest depth. The shading should be light and simple (e.g., a few gently scribbled lines or a light wash of a slightly darker tone on one side of the dog, the base of the flower, under the car, or on one side of the robot's body). Clearly indicate the "shadow" side.
**Step 7: Funky Finishing Touches!***   **Description:** Show the drawing with the addition of simple, fun details that enhance the [**TARGET SUBJECT**]'s appearance and personality (e.g., "adding spots to the dog, details to the flower petals, door handles to the car, or buttons and wires to the robot"). Encourage simple, playful additions.
**Step 8: Show and Tell (The Proud Part!)***   **Description:** Show the completed, simple cartoon drawing of the [**TARGET SUBJECT**] with a bright and cheerful presentation. Optionally, you can include a small, simple graphic (like a star or a smiley face) to indicate completion and pride.
